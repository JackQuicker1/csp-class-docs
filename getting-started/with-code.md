# VS Code Practice

### Clean up the Kitchen

1. Log in to VS Code. In a terminal type this:

{% highlight bash %}
wget https://github.com/woodstockcs/kitchen/archive/main.zip;unzip main.zip;mv kitchen-main kitchen
{% endhighlight %}

1. Look around the kitchen. If you see a cockroach, remove it. (There are 2 of them.)
1. Move all the files into their correct folders.
1. Make a new directory called "closet" alongside the fridge and freezer. This means that `ls` should show: closet freezer fridge
1. Create three new files in the closet. Give them a ".txt" extension, like: pasta.txt

### Hello

1. Type `cd`. This takes you to your home directory, no matter where you are.
1. Type `ls` to confirm. You should see just the kitchen directory.
1. Make a new directory called `u1-python`.
1. `cd` into that directory and type `code hello.py`.
1. Write a short python program that prints hello world. (Feel free to add a creative touch.)
