# For Loops

# Part 1 Warmup (5 minutes)

## 1.1

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Hello")
    count = count + 1
```

**Question:** How many times will this code print "Hello"?

## 1.2

```python
friend = "Alice"
print("Hello", friend)
friend = "Bob"
print("Hello", friend)
```

**Question:** What will this code print?

## 1.3

```python
# We want to say hello to 5 friends:
# Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, and Eddie

count = 0
while count < 5:
    # Yikes... how do we print the right name?
    print("Hello", "???")
    count = count + 1
```

**Question:** Using only what we know about while loops and variables, how could we solve this? What makes it awkward or difficult?

# Part 2. Predictions (15 minutes)

## 2.1

```python
for friend in ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']:
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)
print('Done!')
```

**Questions:**

- a. What gets printed to the screen? Write down the exact output.
- b. How many times does the indented line run?
- c. What happens to the variable 'friend' during each run?

## 2.2

```python
# Program 1
for letter in 'Hi!':
    print(letter)
```

```python
# Program 2
for number in [1, 2, 3]:
    print('Count:', number)
```

**Questions:**

- a. What's similar about how these two programs work?
- b. What kinds of things can we put after the word 'in'?
- c. In Program 1, what value does 'letter' have during each run?

## 2.3

```python
# Program 3
for num in [1, 2]:
    print('Start')
    print(num)
    print('End')
print('All done')
```

```python
# Program 4
for word in ['cat', 'dog']:
    answer = word + '!'
    print(answer)
```

**Questions:**

- a. How many times does 'Start' get printed in Program 3?
- b. What determines which lines are part of the loop?
- c.. What will Program 4 print? Be exact.

Notes to capture:

- pros and cons of the first program that meows 3 times
- what will cause a loop to run forever?
- code for a working while loop
- sketch the flow of a while loop (flowchart or just arrows with code)
- two ways of incrementing (adding 1 to a variable)
- relationship between a for loop and a list
- syntax for a list
- when does a programmer use the variable "\_" -->
<!--

# Part 4: Practice (20-60 minutes)

Students write the output for each program:

```python
# Program 1
for x in "wow":
    print("*")

# Program 2
for x in "wow":
    print(x)

# Program 3
for x in "wow":
    print(x + "!")
```

## Part 2: Code Writing (10 minutes)

Problems progress from guided to independent:

### Task 1: Complete the Code (with support)

```python
# Make this print:
# Go team!
# Go team!
# Go team!

for number in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(_________)  # Students fill in blank
```

### Task 2: Build from Template

```python
# Make this program print:
# hello a
# hello b
# hello c

for _____ in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
    ________________
```

### Task 3: Independent Writing

Write a for loop that prints:

```
1 Mississippi
2 Mississippi
3 Mississippi
4 Mississippi
5 Mississippi
```

## Part 3: Challenge (5 minutes)

For students who finish early:

```python
# Make this pattern:
# *
# **
# ***

# Hint: you can multiply strings!
# Example: "ha" * 3 gives "hahaha"
```

## Help Cards Available

Card 1: For Loop Template

```python
for variable_name in [value1, value2, value3]:
    print(variable_name)
```

Card 2: Common Patterns

```python
# Print same thing multiple times
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("Hello")

# Print each value
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(x)

# Print modified values
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(x + 1)
```

# For Loop Wrap-up

## Quick Check (2 minutes)

Have students write and share with partner:
"A for loop is better than a while loop when..."

## Return to Opening Problem (1 minute)

Show original "headache" problem and its solution:

```python
# Original problem (messy):
count = 0
while count < 5:
    # Yikes... how do we print the right name?
    print("Hello", "???")
    count = count + 1

# Clean solution with for loop:
for name in ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eddie']:
    print("Hello", name)
```

## Exit Ticket (2 minutes)

Give students small paper slip with:

```python
# What will this print?
for letter in "bye":
    print(letter + letter)
```

Write:

1. The output
2. One question you still have about for loops -->
